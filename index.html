          Hi! I'm Menghao, a student at UofT St. George who is specializing in
          computer science. This website is the result of me experimenting with
          html and css. I enjoy creating these fun little projects for my own
          enjoyment. In the near future, I will work on a few large scale
          projects with greater functionality than the ones that I've created so
          far. These projects will be long term and hopefully be of use to
          others. I hope the code I write will have a positive impact on others.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can see some of my projects below. I hope you enjoy testing out my
          projects as much as I enjoyed creating them!
